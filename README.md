# assignment1-303

## Description
The header and cpp file are modular, so the main.cpp function contains the driver code for the program. When run, it will loop through a given file called arrays.txt and prompt the user to perform whatever actions they please with the array. When given the correct command, the program will move on to the next array and repeat until the end of the file.

## Instructions
Pass the file name either as a command line argument or input the name after starting the program. A menu will display and you can choose the commands to perform on the array. Type 'N' to move on to the next array in the input file.
